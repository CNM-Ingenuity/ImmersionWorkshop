# Welcome to Marbles Connect-a-thon with IBM Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud Private (IBP4ICP)

The goal of the lab is to give you hands on experience interacting with IBM Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud Private (IBP4ICP). You will take on the role of an organization that is part of a larger Hyperledger Fabric blockchain consortium called the Marbles business network.

This lab is broken into two parts. In the first part, you will interact with your deployed peer, and enable the Marbles front end application to connect to the marbles chaincode installed on your peer. In the second part, you will go through the process of enabling the Marbles application to deploy inside a Kubernetes cluster. You will be able to transact marbles with the other lab participants who are all acting as their own organizations in the Marbles business network.

!!! note
	This lab runs on Linux on IBM Z images and connects to an IBM Cloud Private cluster. Both environments run on IBM Z systems in the IBM Washington Systems Center (WSC). In order to connect to this environment, you must be VPN'ed into the WSC network. Open your CISCO AnyConnect client and point to: `ssl.wsc.ihost.com`. You will be given IDs and passwords at the beginning of the lab.
